Parse [indicators of compromise](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Indicators-of-Compromise-IOC) in text.

## Capabilities

Currently, this package can the following items in a given text:

- IP address (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Email addresses (both standard format (e.g. ``test@example.com``) and an email with an IP address as the domain (e.g. ``test@[192.168.0.1]``))
- Hosts (including unicode domain names (e.g. ``È©xample.com``))
- URLs
- File Hashes (sha256, sha1, and md5)

Also provides some helpful features like:

- Ability to remove an indicator type after it is parsed - For example, this is helpful if you do not want to parse the host name from a URL. You can setup IOC Finder to remove all URLs from the text after it parses them.
- Ability to set order in which IOCs are parsed

## Installation

To install this package:

```
pip install ioc-finder
```

## Usage

To use this package:

```python
from ioc_finder import find_iocs

```

See [test_ioc_finder.py](https://github.com/fhightower/ioc-finder/blob/master/tests/test_ioc_finder.py) for more examples.
