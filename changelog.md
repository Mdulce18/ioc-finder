## [4.0.0] - 2020.09.09

### Changed

- We are now parsing observables from URL paths by default (see https://github.com/fhightower/ioc-finder/issues/87). If you would like to disable this functionality, you may do so by setting the `parse_from_url_path` keyword argument to `False` when calling the `find_iocs` function (e.g. `parse_from_url_path=False`).

## <= 3.1.2 - 2020.08.29
